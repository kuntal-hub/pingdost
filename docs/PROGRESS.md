## 2026-10-18 — Phase 01: Repo bootstrap — ✅ done
**Done:**
- User decisions:
  - license **AGPL-3.0-or-later** (ADR 0001);
  - **no pushes by Claude**: the user pushes manually;
  - the user will create the GitHub repo by hand (no `gh` CLI).
  - All three are recorded in `CLAUDE.md` → "Git remote".
- **Tooling and layout:**
  - `git init -b main`; root tooling: pnpm workspace with a `catalog:` of exact versions, Turborepo (transit-node pattern), `tsconfig.base.json`, ESLint 10 flat config (typed lint, import-x ordering, A10 import guards), Prettier, and a root Vitest `projects` config;
  - 11 skeleton packages plus a real `packages/config`;
  - `docker-compose.yml`: `mongo:8.0.34` (rs0, auto-initiated by the healthcheck), `valkey/valkey:8.1.10-alpine`, `axllent/mailpit:v1.31.6`;
  - `.env.example`, CI workflow, README / LICENSE / SECURITY / CONTRIBUTING, and the `CLAUDE.md` Commands section.
- **`@pingdost/config`:** all REQ §17 + A11 variables, bounded integers, cross-field rules, all-or-none feature groups, production fail-fast (dev-only keys rejected), value-free errors, and a `/public` client entry. Conventions are in ADR 0002.

**Deviations / decisions:**
- ADR 0001 (license) and ADR 0002 (config conventions). ARCHITECTURE A1 (CI) and A10 (license) were updated.
- **TypeScript 6.0.3, not 7.0.2.** typescript-eslint 8.71.2 supports TS `<6.1`. TS 6 defaults `types: []`, so packages opt in (`"types": ["node"]`).
- **CI integration job:** it uses `docker compose up -d --wait mongo valkey` instead of GitHub service containers, because service containers can't pass `--replSet`.
- **Vitest:** each package with tests has its own `vitest.config.ts`; the root config globs `{apps,packages,tools}/*/vitest.config.ts`.
- **Build scripts:** pnpm `allowBuilds: { unrs-resolver: false }` (its postinstall is only a binary check). `ignoredBuiltDependencies` is deprecated in pnpm 10.26+.
- **Extra cross-field rules** beyond the phase list: quota ≥ max attachment size, access TTL < refresh TTL, OTP cooldown < OTP TTL, and no `EMAIL_CONSOLE_SHOW_CONTENT` in production.

**Verification results:**
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (clean reinstall), then `pnpm turbo run lint typecheck test --force`: 25/25 tasks pass, with 66 config tests.
- `pnpm format:check` passes.
- `pnpm test:int` runs, but there are no integration tests yet ("no tasks").
- Root `pnpm exec vitest run`: 66 pass.
- `pnpm infra:up`: all three containers healthy.
  - Mongo: `setName=rs0`, PRIMARY, majority write OK via `?replicaSet=rs0`.
  - Valkey: PONG.
  - Mailpit: `/readyz` returns 200.
  - Host ports 27017, 6379, 1025 and 8025 are reachable.
- ESLint guard verified: importing `./server` from `public.ts` errors.
- **Not run:** GitHub CI, because there is no remote yet. The user must create the repo and push, then check the Actions tab.

**Known issues / tech debt:**
- Git Bash fails to fork on this PC (`fork: Resource temporarily unavailable`). Use PowerShell.
- Docker Desktop doesn't auto-start; launch it before `pnpm infra:up`.
- Root config files (`eslint.config.js`, `vitest.config.ts`) are formatted by Prettier but not linted or typechecked.
- `turbo.json` `test:int` passes through only `MONGODB_URI` and `REDIS_URL`; Phase 5 adds more. The Phase 5 file was updated with this and the Mailpit CI step.
- pnpm is pinned to the installed 10.28.1 (latest is 12.x); upgrade only deliberately.

**Next:** Phase 02 (crypto spike A).
- Rust is **not installed**. The user needs rustup, and likely the MSVC C++ Build Tools (free); give them numbered steps first.
- Also check the license of every crate and npm package against AGPL-3.0 (ADR 0001).

## 2026-10-18 — Planning session — ✅ done
**Done:**
- Read the REQ doc. Asked the user four questions:
  - test devices: 2+ Android phones, focus on Android + web;
  - hosting: decide later;
  - social login: Google only;
  - license: open source.
- Created `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` (30 phases), `docs/CHANGES.md`, `docs/decisions/`, and `docs/phases/phase-01…30`.

**Deviations / decisions:** see `docs/CHANGES.md` (initial entries) and the ⚠ items in ARCHITECTURE.

**Verification results:** documentation only; no code yet. The repo is not yet a git repository (Phase 1 runs `git init`).

**Machine facts:**
- Installed: Node 24.11, pnpm 10.28, Docker 29.4, git 2.52, Android SDK (adb 1.0.41), JDK 17 (OpenLogic), Python 3.11.
- **Not installed:** Rust (needed in Phase 2), plus likely MSVC C++ Build Tools and the Android NDK (Phases 2–3).

**Next:** "start phase 1".
